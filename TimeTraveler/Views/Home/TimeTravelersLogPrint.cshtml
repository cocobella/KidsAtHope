                    Wow, what an adventure! You visited your future. Not
                    everyone knows how to do that, but you do. As a Time Traveler
                    you discovered that you have many of the skills and talents you
                    will need on your journey to your destinations.

                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        @{ foreach (var str in Model.Likes)
                            {
                                <li><em>@str</em></li>
                            }
                        }

                    </ul>
                <p>
                    Take a moment and think how your talents will be of
                    importance to you. As importantly, you will continue to get
                    better with each of your talents and you will pick up more on
                    the way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remember, the harder you try the better you will get. So
                    always try your best in everything you do. Never Give Up.
