            Hi <span class="visitorName">@Model.Name</span>,
            Wow, what an adventure! You visited your future. Not
            everyone knows how to do that, but you do. As a Time Traveler
            you discovered that you have many of the skills and talents you
            will need on your journey to your destinations.

                    <li><em>@str</em></li>
                }
            }
            
        </ul>
        <p>
            Take a moment and think how your talents will be of
            importance to you. As importantly, you will continue to get
            better with each of your talents and you will pick up more on
            the way.
